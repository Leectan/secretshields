## What workflow got disrupted?

<!-- Describe what you were doing and how SecretShields interfered. e.g., "I was copying a code snippet and it got masked even though it wasn't a secret" -->

## Expected behavior

<!-- What should have happened instead? -->

## Suggested fix

<!-- Any ideas? e.g., "Add a quick-dismiss shortcut", "Don't mask inside markdown code blocks" -->

## Settings questions

- Should `autoMask` be on or off by default? <!-- Current default: true -->
- Is the poll interval too aggressive? <!-- Current default: 1000ms -->
- Should editor paste masking default to `offer` or `off`? <!-- Current default: offer -->

## Environment

- **OS**: <!-- e.g., macOS 14.2, Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04 -->
- **IDE**: <!-- e.g., VS Code 1.92, Cursor 0.40 -->
- **SecretShields version**: <!-- e.g., 0.2.0 -->

# SecretShields

Local-first clipboard secret masking for VS Code / Cursor.

## What it does

- Detects common credential formats (API keys, tokens, database URLs, SSH private keys, JWTs)
- Masks secrets **in your system clipboard** so pastes are safer across apps (AI chats, terminals, pastebins)
- Keeps a local exposure log (masked previews only) and can remind you to rotate leaked credentials

## Install

- VS Code Marketplace: see the extension listing for `SecretShields`
- OpenVSX (Cursor): see the OpenVSX listing for `SecretShields`

/**
 * @secretshields Chat Participant — POST-MVP
 *
 * This file is a placeholder for the @secretshields chat participant feature.
 * It will only be implemented after MVP ships and after intentionally
 * bumping `engines.vscode` to the minimum version that supports
 * Chat Participants across target IDEs (VS Code + Cursor).
 *
 * Planned behavior:
 * - User pastes text to @secretshields in the chat panel
 * - Extension replies with a masked version
 * - Clear "copy this into your AI chat" instructions
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a masking assistant only.
 * It does NOT forward to Cursor/Copilot providers.
 * It does NOT intercept or modify other chat systems' messages.
 *
 * Prerequisites before implementation:
 * 1. Verify Chat Participants API is stable in target vscode.d.ts baseline
 * 2. Bump engines.vscode to required minimum
 * 3. Add "contributes.chatParticipants" to package.json
 * 4. Test in both VS Code and Cursor
